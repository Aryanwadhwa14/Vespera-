## Project Overview
The **Community Solar Investment Platform** is designed to empower communities by enabling users to invest in shared solar projects. Users can purchase shares in solar initiatives, track their energy savings, and contribute to a sustainable future. This platform promotes renewable energy accessibility, community engagement, and environmental consciousness.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: 
  - **HTML**: Structure and layout of the web pages.
  - **CSS**: Styling for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
  - **JavaScript**: Interactive features and dynamic content.
  - **React.js**: For building reusable components and managing the user interface.

- **Backend**:
  - **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime for handling requests and managing data.
  - **Express.js**: Framework for building web applications on Node.js.

- **Database**:
  - **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user profiles, solar projects, and transaction history.

- **AI Models**:
  - **Energy Demand Forecasting**: Utilizing LSTM neural networks to predict energy consumption patterns.
  - **Solar Generation Prediction**: Implementing CNNs for accurate solar power generation forecasts.
  - **Predictive Maintenance**: Using anomaly detection algorithms for early fault detection in solar infrastructure.
  - **Dynamic Pricing Model**: Reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize share pricing based on market conditions.

## Features
- **User Registration & Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login processes for users.
- **Investment Dashboard**: Users can view available solar projects, purchase shares, and track their investments.
- **Energy Savings Tracking**: Real-time tracking of energy savings based on users’ investments and solar generation.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Personalized recommendations and forecasts for energy savings and investment opportunities.
- **Community Engagement**: Forum for users to discuss projects, share experiences, and engage with other community members.
- **Transparent Reporting**: Detailed reports on energy production, savings, and carbon offsets.

## AI Models
The platform leverages advanced AI models to enhance user experience and ensure sustainability:
- **Energy Demand Forecasting**: Predicts energy needs using historical data to optimize supply.
- **Solar Generation Prediction**: Forecasts solar energy production based on weather data, improving reliability.
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Detects potential issues in solar infrastructure to prevent downtime and ensure efficiency.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Adjusts share prices in real time based on supply and demand, maximizing returns for users.
